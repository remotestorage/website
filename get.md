# Getting Started

Here are the steps to using an app that allows you to connect your own storage account: ðŸ‘‡

1. Sign up for a remoteStorage account
   - If a friend or administrator has set up an account for you, get the details from them.
   - [5apps](https://5apps.com/storage/beta) is a commercial remoteStorage provider that currently offers free storage accounts.
   - A more extensive list of options can be found on the [Servers](/servers) page.
2. After creating your account, return to the app to 'connect your storage', or explore some of the other [remoteStorage-compatible apps](/apps).
