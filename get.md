# Getting Started

1. Sign up for a remoteStorage account
   - If a friend or administrator has set up an account for you, get the details from them.
   - [5apps](https://5apps.com/storage/beta) is a commercial remoteStorage provider that currently offers free storage accounts.
   - A more extensive list of options can be found on the [Servers](/servers) page.
2. If you navigated here from an app, it's waiting for you in another tab! 
   Or try one of the [apps which store your data using remoteStorage](/apps).
