# Getting Started

1. Sign up for a remoteStorage account
    - If a friend or administrator has set up an account for you, get the details from them.
    - [5apps](https://5apps.com/storage/beta) is a commercial
     remoteStorage provider that currently offers free storage accounts.
2. If you navigated here from an app, it's waiting for you in another tab! 
   Or try one of the [apps which store your data using remoteStorage](/apps).
