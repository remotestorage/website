## Repo

  - There's a design repo with logo/icon files etc. on GitHub:
    <https://github.com/remotestorage/design/>
  - We have an ongoing issue about refreshing the official logo there:
    <https://github.com/remotestorage/design/issues/1>

## Connect Widget

Another ongoing topic is the refreshing of the connect widget, which is
currently shipped with the remoteStorage.js library. Plans are to
extract it from the core library to a seperate widget add-on library.
@gillisig created a new design and flow, complete with interactive flow
mockups, and raucao started implementing the widget library.

## Websites

We just launched a basic new website, but it still/always needs work.
It's a great point of entry for designers and frontend developers
wanting to contribute to the project.

  - Waffle board (using GH issues):
